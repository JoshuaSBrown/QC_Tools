# Arguments

The arguments classes are used to define the criteria that the arguments passed in from the command line should meet. 

For instance if you are passing the a file name in then there will be an argument class for dealing with file names. If you are passing integer in there will be a argument class for deaing with integers. 

# Properties

The properties classes are the criteria used to check the arguments. For instance if a file argument is passed in, for the file name to be valid maybe it needs to exist or have a relevant extension. There are properties defined for this kind of functionality.
