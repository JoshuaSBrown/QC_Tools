 # Outline 

Flow of the calc_J should follow as:

1. Read arguments
2. Assign files to atomic groups
3. Read atomic coordinates
4. Create group container
5. Assign group types
6. Create atom system
7. Check basis sets line up between components and complex
8. Load overlap matrices and molecular orbital coefficients
9. Create swap engine  
10. Order matrices if needed
11. Generate Transfer integral complex
12. Calculate transfer integral
