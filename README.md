## Objective

CATNIP is meant to make difficult calculations accessible to the masses. The focus is to accelerate science and industry by:
 * using an accessible license
 * providing good documentation
 * easy installation
 * sharing ownership and encouraging collaboration
 
I welcome feedback and contributors. If you have suggestions for integrating CATNIP with other programs please do not hesitate to create an issue or contact me on gitter:

If you run into a problem feel free to create an issue on [github](https://github.com/JoshuaSBrown/QC_Tools/issues)

## Citing

If you use CATNIP to get values for a paper it would be nice if you cited it. To know how to cite it you can simply pass the folloing -cite flag to `calc_J` as:

```calc_J -cite```
