## Objective

CATNIP is meant to make difficult calculations accessible to the masses. The focus is to accelerate science and industry by:
 * using an accessible license
 * providing good documentation
 * easy installation
 * sharing ownership and encouraging collaboration
 
I welcome feedback and contributors. If you have suggestions for integrating CATNIP with other programs please do not hesitate to create an issue or contact me on gitter. You can do this by clicking on the gitter badge.

If you run into a problem feel free to create an issue on [github](https://github.com/JoshuaSBrown/QC_Tools/issues), if I do not respond promptly feel free to reach out again. Often responses get filtered to my spam folder or I simply do not see them.

## Citing

If you use CATNIP to get values for a paper it would be nice if you cited it. To know how to cite it you can simply pass the folloing -cite flag to `calc_J` as:

```calc_J -cite```
